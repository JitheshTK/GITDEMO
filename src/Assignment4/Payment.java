/*Define a class named Payment that contains a member variable of type double that stores the amount of the payment and appropriate accessor and mutator methods. Also create a method named paymentDetails that outputs an English sentence to describe the amount of the payment.  

Next, define a class named CashPayment that is derived from Payment. This class should redefine the paymentDetails method to indicate that the payment is in cash. Include appropriate constructor(s).  

Define a class named CreditCardPayment that is derived from Payment. This class should contain member variables for the name on the card, expiration date, and credit card number. Include appropriate constructor(s). Finally, redefine the paymentDetails method to include all credit card information in the printout.  

Create a main method that creates at least two CashPayment and two  

CreditCardPayment objects with different values and calls paymentDetails for each.
